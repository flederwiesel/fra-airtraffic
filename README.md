fra-airtraffic screensaver

Inspired by the Star Alliance screensaver, which sadly has been discontinued for
some years now, I decided to write my own air traffic screensaver now. The
screensaver will display flights from/to Frankfurt International Airport upon
an earth image as shown above.

Limitations
---

- No actual routes will be displayed, the shown flight path is the shortest
(great circle) path between two airports.
- Only scheduled operations will be shown. In the initial release static data
(not current) will be used.
- Stopovers will not be considered.


Planned features
-

- Online update of program binaries
- Daily updated flight data
- Realtime (not accelerated) display
- Show day/night terminator
- Colour selection

Supported Platforms
---

Currently, there is only a Windows version available. An xscreensaver plugin
for Linux users is in progress. As of now, I cannot tell when a Mac version will
be available.
